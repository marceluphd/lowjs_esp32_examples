Example using a native module


Step 1: Make sure low_native_api directory is cloned:

git submodule update --init


Step 2: Compile the low_native_api library (only required to compile the
        native module, which is Step 3):

cd low_native_api
make
cd ..


Step 3: Compile the native module:

make


Step 4: Run low.js script:

low src/index.js



To see what is happening, take a look at src/index.js. It loads src/native.so which
is compiled from src/native.c by the Makefile.
