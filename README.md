Example projects and drivers for neonious one and low.js for ESP32


# lowjs

low.js is a free to use and open sourced port of the JavaScript runtime Node.js with far lower system requirements, allowing it to run on cheap, power-efficient microcontroller boards based on the ESP32-WROVER module.
It also runs on Linux based systems as a smaller, faster booting alternative to Node.JS.

For more information on low.js, please visit http://www.lowjs.org/ .
